# Update-Major-and-minor-version-of-postgreSQL
In PostgreSQL, major version upgrades and minor version upgrades refer to different types of updates to the database software, and each has its own process and requirements:


---

1. Major Version Upgrade

Definition: A major version upgrade involves upgrading to a new PostgreSQL release with new features, enhancements, and changes that may break compatibility with the previous version. For example:

From PostgreSQL 14 to PostgreSQL 15.


Impact:

May involve catalog changes, which means the internal database structure may differ.

Application changes may be needed if the new version introduces incompatible behavior.



Methods for Major Version Upgrade

1. Logical Backup and Restore:

Take a full backup using tools like pg_dump or pg_dumpall.

Install the new version.

Restore the data into the new version.

Best for small-to-medium databases but slower for large databases.



2. In-place Upgrade Using pg_upgrade:

Faster method for large databases.

Preserves database files while upgrading system catalogs.

Requires both old and new PostgreSQL versions to be installed on the same server.




Prerequisites

Ensure sufficient disk space for backup and temporary files.

Validate compatibility of extensions, plugins, and client applications.

Review release notes for deprecated or removed features.

Take a full backup of the database.

Test the upgrade in a staging environment.


Post-requisites

Verify application functionality with the new version.

Update any client drivers or applications if needed.

Remove old PostgreSQL binaries and configuration files after successful migration.

Monitor performance for any unexpected issues.

2. Minor Version Upgrade

Definition: A minor version upgrade updates the database within the same major version to fix bugs, enhance security, and address performance issues. For example:

From PostgreSQL 15.2 to PostgreSQL 15.3.


Impact:

No changes to the internal database structure.

Typically does not require application changes.

Safe and faster compared to major upgrades.



Method for Minor Version Upgrade

Binary Replacement:

Stop the database server.

Install the new version using the package manager (yum, apt, etc.).

Restart the database server.

This is typically seamless and does not require data dump/restore.



Prerequisites

Take a backup of the database for safety.

Validate the installed extensions for compatibility.

Check release notes for any behavioral changes.


Post-requisites

Verify the server is running the upgraded version using SELECT version();.

Monitor the database logs for any errors or warnings.

How to Perform These Upgrades as a DBA

1. Major Version Upgrade Steps

Prepare:

Review compatibility in the PostgreSQL Release Notes.

Test the upgrade in a non-production environment.

Backup your data: pg_dumpall or pg_basebackup.


Upgrade:

Install the new version binaries.

Use pg_upgrade:

pg_upgrade -b /old/bin/path -B /new/bin/path -d /old/data/path -D /new/data/path

Restart the PostgreSQL server.


Validate:

Check the upgraded cluster with pg_upgradeâ€™s --check option.

Test database and application behavior.



### Minor Version Upgrade Steps

Prepare:

Take a backup of the database.

Read the release notes for known issues.


Upgrade:

stop the PostgreSQL service:

sudo systemctl stop postgresql-16

Install the new version using the package manager.

sudo yum update postgresql16

start the PostgreSQL service:

sudo systemctl start postgresql-16


Validate:

Verify the version with:

SELECT version();

Check for errors in the PostgreSQL logs.

Best Practices

1. Plan Downtime: Schedule upgrades during maintenance windows.


2. Backup First: Always have a recent backup in case of failures.


3. Test: Perform upgrades in a test/staging environment before production.


4. Monitor: Post-upgrade, monitor the system for issues such as performance degradation or unexpected behavior.
